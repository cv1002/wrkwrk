# wrkwrk - a HTTP benchmarking tool

  wrkwrk is a modern HTTP benchmarking tool capable of generating significant
  load when run on a single multi-core CPU. It combines a multithreaded
  design with scalable event notification systems such as epoll and kqueue.

  An optional LuaJIT script can perform HTTP request generation, response
  processing, and custom reporting. Details are available in SCRIPTING and
  several examples are located in [scripts/](scripts/).
